// Properties for simple MDP

// P1: Maximum probability of reaching goal (should be 1.0 - deterministic)
Pmax=? [ F goal ]

// P2: Minimum steps to reach goal
R{"steps"}min=? [ F goal ]

// P3: Maximum probability of reaching goal in exactly 4 steps
Pmax=? [ F=4 goal ]

// P4: Can we reach goal with probability 1?
Pmax>=1.0 [ F goal ]
